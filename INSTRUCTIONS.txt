   python
   node
   nodemon
   npm

Create a new directory, 
   mkdir dist

Run this code:
   emcc src/click_counter.c -o dist/click-counter.js -s NO_EXIT_RUNTIME=1 -s "EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS=['ccall']" -s LINKABLE=1 -s EXPORT_ALL=1

This command will create .js and .wasm file into your dist

To copy your changes, you want to save it to your DIST directory:
   cp src/*.html dist


To run your program, use this code:
   npm run start

This call will run the functions from package.json . You should see the following:
